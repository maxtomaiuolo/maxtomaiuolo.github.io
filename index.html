  <p>The 2020 NFL draft class featured three rising stars that would reshape three football franchises forever.</p> 
  <p>Louisiana State quarterback Joe Burrow won the Heisman Trophy in his senior season and led the Tigers to their fourth national championship in program history. Burrow not only won the title in his last year but also finished with 60 passing touchdowns in 2019, the most by any QB in college history.</p>
  <p>Tua Tagovailoa, Alabama's gunslinger, entered with similar accolades. Tagovailoa exploded into the college football world as a freshman, tossing a game-winning touchdown pass in overtime of the national championship game. He was named Offensive MVP of the 2018 College Football Playoffs and received multiple awards for the sport's best player. Tagovailoa was projected to be the top overall selection entering his junior year, but a season-ending hip injury made him fall in the draft.</p> 
  <p>Justin Herbert, Oregon's quarterback, finished his senior season with 3,471 passing yards and 32 passing touchdowns. The Eugene native won the 2019 Pac-12 championship his junior year and was named MVP of the Rose Bowl in 2020. With many expecting the Cincinnati Bengals to pick Burrow with the first overall selection, experts were split on where Tagovailoa and Herbert would fall.</p>

      <h2><b>Joe Burrow</h2></b>

      <p>The Cincinnati Bengals selected Burrow with the first overall pick of the 2020 draft. The LSU product was the only first-year quarterback to start on opening week, throwing for 193 passing yards with an interception against the Chargers. Through his first 10 games, the Bengals' rookie tallied 2,688 passing yards while adding 13 touchdown passes. Unfortunately, Burrow's first season was cut short when he tore both ligaments in his knee while playing Washington Commanders. A promising year was cut short, but the rookie returned better than ever.</p>

      <p>A "sophomore slump" was no way to describe Burrow's second season behind center. The Cincinnati quarterback led the league in completion percentage (70.4%) through 16 games, adding 34 touchdowns on 14 interceptions.</p>
      <p>However, Burrow's most impressive performances came in the playoffs. After beating the Raiders in the wild-card round, the LSU product carried the Bengals on the road past the top seeded Titans. In the AFC championship game, Burrow tossed 250 yards and two touchdowns in an overtime victory against a heavily favored Chiefs team, leading the Bengals to their first Super Bowl appearance since 1989. Although Cincinnati fell to the Rams by three points in the Super Bowl, the Bengals had undoubtedly found their franchise quarterback in Burrow.</p>

<br>


      <p>Now in his third season, Burrow is only getting better. Compared to all quarterbacks who were drafted with or after him, the Cincinnati gunslinger ranks first in passing yards and touchdowns. In fact, Burrow ranks third in yards and second in touchdown passes to this point in the season. The first-overall pick has dominated the NFL and should do so for a long time.</p>

      <h2><b>Tua Tagovailoa</h2></b>
    <img class="story_image" src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/11/13/USAT/63449b3c-8799-48c6-8468-8394408e5e87-USP_NFL__Cleveland_Browns_at_Miami_Dolphins.jpg?width=660&height=440&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp">
      <p class="caption">Tagovailoa has flourished under new head coach Mike McDaniel, leading the Dolphins to an 8-5 record so far in 2022. | Photo by Jasen Vinlove, USA TODAY Sports https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/11/13/USAT/63449b3c-8799-48c6-8468-8394408e5e87-USP_NFL__Cleveland_Browns_at_Miami_Dolphins.jpg?width=660&height=440&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp</p>


      <p>Tagovailoa was selected fifth overall by the Miami Dolphins. Due to his severe hip injury in college, Tua sat out to start the 2020 season. He made his starting debut in week eight against the Rams, finishing with 93 passing yards and a touchdown. Head coach Brian Flores wasn't convinced with Tagovailoa during his rookie year and constantly flipped between him and Ryan Fitzpatrick behind center. Thus, the Alabama product finished his first year with 1,814 yards and 11 touchdown passes in 10 games.</p>

      <p>The southpaw became the starting quarterback in his second season for Miami. The Dolphins got off to a disastrous start, opening the campaign 1-7. Tagovailoa was quickly running out of chances to become an elite NFL QB. However, the Fins won their next seven games and even had a chance to make the playoffs. In a must-win matchup against the Titans late in the regular season, Tagovailoa failed miserably, losing 34-3 to end the Dolphins' season effectively. Tua only had one more year to prove himself.</p>

      <p>In a surprise move, the Dolphins fired Flores immediately following the 2021 season. There was speculation that Tagovailoa's relationship with his head coach had gone sour, ultimately leading to Flores's dismissal. Miami brought in offensive-minded head coach Mike McDaniel and traded for star wide-receiver Tyreek Hill from the Chiefs to set Tua up for success.</p>

      <br>

      <p>With this added weaponry, Tagovailoa has looked much better in his third season behind center. Through week 13, Tua led the league in passer rating, which is calculated using a variety of quarterback statistics. Miami sits at 8-5 and is bound for its first playoff appearance since 2016. It's been a rollercoaster ride for the Hawaii native, but he has excelled with the right coach and system.</p>

            <h2><b>Justin Herbert</h2></b>
    <img class="story_image" src="https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/_MGF5KUu01IZ83s9F5z3C6DZKQA=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/HHI4YL4TVJCCHCIKPCPGQUDQNM.jpg">

      <p>The Los Angeles Chargers selected Herbert with the sixth overall selection. After sitting out in week one, the Oregon standout started the following week against the Chiefs, tossing for 311 yards and a touchdown. Herbert won the 2020 Offensive Rookie of the Year and led Los Angeles to a 7-9 record. The Chargers quarterback finished with the most touchdown passes by a first-year QB in league history (31) and 4,336 passing yards, the second most by a rookie all-time.</p>

      <p>Herbert continued to thrive in his second season, finishing with the second-most passing yards in the league (5,014). Under new head coach Brandon Staley, Herbert tossed an AFC-best 38 touchdown passes and got the Chargers within one game of the playoffs.</p>

      <p>Despite cracking his ribs in week two against the Chiefs, Herbert is yet to miss a start in 2022. Herbert is arguably the most effective when comparing the three quarterbacks' statistics. The LA gunslinger currently has 3,706 passing yards and 21 touchdown passes in his third year.</p>

      <h2><b>So, who's the best?</h2></b>

           <img class="story_image" src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_720,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/https-3A-2F-2Fstripehype-com-2Fwp-content-2Fuploads-2Fgetty-images-2F2018-2F08-2F1352153701-850x560-20919c633bd7e34629b670b1eb940ec6.jpg">

           <br>
           <br>

      <p>Falk College's Dave Meluni says the answer is tough and will take time. "Right now, to be safe, I'd take Joe Burrow," Meluni said. "But the projected to be the best is probably Herbert." Burrow is the ultimate leader, carrying his team to the Super Bowl in his second season. While Herbert's pure talent may be a little better, Meluni says until the Chargers quarterback makes a run in the playoffs, he is still siding with Burrow.</p>

      <p>It's hard to argue against picking the Cincinnati QB. Burrow has it all: the skills, the experience and the leadership. Plus, the Bengals are getting hot at the right time again in 2022, winning seven of their last eight games. Cincinnati is primed to make another deep playoff run, which Herbert has never done before. All three quarterbacks can potentially be the league's best signal-caller, but Burrow is the top dog right now.</p>
